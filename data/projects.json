    "desc": "The main objective of this project is to compare the performance of suppliers who provide key components for anti-vibration tables. Before assembly, each component undergoes an initial inspection based on the company's internal quality standards. By collecting and analyzing the number of components that pass or fail this inspection for each supplier",
